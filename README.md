# BiscuitDAO

This is a fun example repo of a DataDAO called BiscuitDAO (Biscuit is name of the Filecoin Corgi Mascot)! This repo is meant to give a simple example of how a simple DataDAO might be structured. To learn more about where this project idea came from and what a DataDAO is, checkout [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o58CMUURDEo).


If you're completely new to DAO's you may want to start out with [fevm-data-dao-kit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-data-dao-kit).
